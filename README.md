# house-downpayment-calculator
Calculates the time it will take to afford the downpayment on a home.

ps1a has a simple calculation that will ask for a salary, the percentage to save, and the cost of the house. It will then return how many months it will take to pay off the downpayment of the house.

ps1b calculates the same but includes a semi-annual raise.

ps1c3 uses any yearly salary inputted into it to calculate how much of a percentage the user needs to save in 36 months to afford a 1000000 dollar house downpayment.
